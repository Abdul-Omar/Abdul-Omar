      Understanding the mechanics of advanced data structures and algorithms is 
      an important skill to have as a software engineer. In this field, you are always 
      surrounded by data and are always tasked with storing and organizing data.

        I have prepared this course with goal of teaching data structures 
        in the least confusing manner taking into account various level of 
        skill
        and exposure to data structures and algorithms. This course will be 
        in c++ and Java.
        Hence, familiarity with the basic syntax is assumed, if not expected.

        We will start with basic data structues such as arrays, vectors, arraylists
        stack and queue. Then, later on we will move on to advanced data structures
        and algorithms. These advanced data structures include Binary Trees, KD-Trees,
        Multi-Way Tries, Ternary Search Tries. We will also study graphs and advanced
        graph algorithms including Dijkstras shortest path algorithm, Kruskals algorithm
        that finds Minimum Spanning Trees(MSTs). To cap it all, we will look at the A* algorithm
        also used in findind the shortest path from one point to another on a graph that
        uses a heuristic function to smartly find the shortest path.

        In addition to written material, I will also post video tutorials on Youtube. 
        click the link to my Youtube channel to help with the the understanding of the content
        The number of videos posted will be proportional to the interest shown by the 
        followers of the course and questions asked there.

        Only through constant practice and strictest self-criticism may we
        develop a sense for a perfect piece of work. Unfortunately, most
        seem content with a middling performance. Careful spacing of words
        and the correct spacing of capital letters appear to be unknown or
        unimportant to some typesetters, yet for him who investigates, the
        correct rules are not difficult to discover.
